This is a sample code showing how to call Famark Cloud API to store and retrieve data from a NodeJS application.

### Setup Steps:
1. This example requires **Famark Cloud Instance**, you can [register free instance](https://www.famark.com/Install/?ic=FreeDev) or sign in to your [existing instance](https://www.famark.com/).
2. This example performs *Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete (CRUD)* actions on *Contact* entity present in *Business Solution*, so make sure you have the Business solution is installed in your instance, if not installed then goto:- 
*`Solutions > more actions (...) > Import Solution > Import From Store > Business Solution Install > Import Solution`*
3. Clone this repository and run `npm install` from root to get package dependencies.
